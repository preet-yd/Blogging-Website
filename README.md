# Medium Clone Project

Welcome to the Medium Clone project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of Medium using the following stack:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Validation Library**: Zod
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **ORM**: Prisma with connection pooling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <repository_url>

**Stack Details**
Frontend
The frontend of this project is built using React. You can find the frontend code in the frontend directory. React offers a flexible and efficient way to create user interfaces.

Backend
Cloudflare Workers are used for the backend implementation. Cloudflare Workers provide a serverless execution environment, enabling you to run server-side logic without managing infrastructure.

Validation Library
Zod is used as the validation library, offering type inference for frontend types. It provides a simple and ergonomic API for defining schemas and validating data.

Language
TypeScript is the chosen language for this project. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enabling better developer tooling, code maintainability, and overall code quality.

ORM and Database
Prisma is used as the ORM with connection pooling. It provides a type-safe way to interact with the database and supports various databases, including PostgreSQL, which is used as the database for this project.

Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for authentication. JWT provides a secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
